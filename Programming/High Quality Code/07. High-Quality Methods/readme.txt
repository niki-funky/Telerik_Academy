01. Task ->
Take the VS solution "Methods" and refactor its code to follow the guidelines
of high-quality methods. Ensure you handle errors correctly: when the methods
cannot do what their name says, throw an exception (do not return wrong result).
Ensure good cohesion and coupling, good naming, no side effects, etc.

Notes:
Main Method is in the Demo.cs
Tests are in Demo.cs
